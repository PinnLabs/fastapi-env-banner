# GitHub Pages Setup Checklist

Save here for future references

Follow these steps to enable GitHub Pages for your documentation:

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub

First, commit and push all the documentation files:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add MkDocs documentation site"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/pinnlabs/fastapi-env-banner`
2. Click on **Settings** (top right)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save** (if there's a save button)

### 3. Verify Workflow

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow called "Deploy Documentation"
3. If it hasn't run yet, it will run automatically on the next push to `main`
4. Or you can manually trigger it:
   - Click on "Deploy Documentation"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select branch `main`
   - Click "Run workflow"

### 4. Wait for Deployment

- The workflow takes about 1-2 minutes to complete
- You can watch the progress in the Actions tab
- Once complete, you'll see a green checkmark ‚úÖ

### 5. Access Your Documentation

Once deployed, your documentation will be available at:

**https://pinnlabs.github.io/fastapi-env-banner/**

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails

If the workflow fails:

1. Check the error message in the Actions tab
2. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies (already added to `pyproject.toml`)
   - Build errors (test locally with `mkdocs build --strict`)
   - Permissions issues (check repository settings)

### Documentation Not Appearing

If the site doesn't load:

1. Wait a few minutes (can take up to 10 minutes for first deployment)
2. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings ‚Üí Pages
3. Verify the workflow completed successfully
4. Try accessing the URL in an incognito/private window (cache issue)

### 404 Error

If you get a 404 error:

1. Make sure the workflow has completed
2. Check that the source is set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. Wait a few more minutes and try again

## üîÑ Updating Documentation

After the initial setup, updating is easy:

1. Edit any `.md` file in the `docs/` directory
2. Commit and push to `main`:
   ```bash
   git add docs/
   git commit -m "Update documentation"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. The workflow will automatically rebuild and deploy
4. Changes will be live in 1-2 minutes

## üß™ Testing Before Deploy

Always test locally before pushing:

```bash
# Build to check for errors
uv run mkdocs build --strict

# Preview locally
uv run mkdocs serve
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 to verify everything looks good.

## üìù Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `docs/` directory with your domain
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Update the `site_url` in `mkdocs.yml`
4. See [GitHub Pages custom domain docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

## ‚ú® You're Done!

Once GitHub Pages is enabled and the workflow runs successfully, your documentation will be live and automatically updated with every push to `main`.
